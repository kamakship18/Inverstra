# ü§ñ Fetch.ai Integration for Inverstra

## üåü Overview

This document describes the comprehensive Fetch.ai integration for the Inverstra platform. 

**What Fetch.ai Does in Inverstra:**
Fetch.ai brings specialized AI agents to enhance our financial prediction platform. Instead of relying on a single AI model, we now have multiple specialized agents that work together:

- **Prediction Analyzer Agent** - Evaluates the credibility and market alignment of investment predictions
- **Market Data Collector Agent** - Gathers real-time market data from multiple sources
- **Risk Assessment Agent** - Analyzes investment risks and volatility
- **News Aggregator Agent** - Collects and analyzes financial news sentiment
- **DAO Governance Agent** - Assists community voting decisions

These agents work in parallel to provide more accurate, comprehensive analysis than traditional single-model approaches. They earn tokens for quality work and can be monitored in real-time through our dashboard.
